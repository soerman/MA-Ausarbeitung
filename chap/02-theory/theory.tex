\section{Photonic time-stretch analog-to-digital converter}

"' In recent and future synchrotron radiation facilities, relativistic electron bunches with increasingly high charge density are needed for producing brilliant light at various wavelengths, from X-rays to terahertz. In such conditions, interaction of electron bunches with their own emitted electromagnetic fields leads to instabilities and spontaneous formation of complex spatial structures. Understanding these instabilities is therefore key in most electron accelerators. However, investigations suffer from the lack of non-destructive recording tools for electron bunch shapes. In storage rings, most studies thus focus on the resulting emitted radiation. Here, we present measurements of the electric field in the immediate vicinity of the electron bunch in a storage ring, over many turns. For recording the ultrafast electric field, we designed a photonic time-stretch analog-to-digital converter with terasamples/second acquisition rate. We could thus observe the predicted link between spontaneous pattern formation and giant bursts of coherent synchrotron radiation in a storage ring. "'  \cite{Bielawski2019}

\section{Characteristics of Analog-To-Digital-Converters}
Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are used to translate analog quantities into digital signals, which can be processed by information processing, computing, data transmission and control systems. This section covers the different characteristics of an ADC, which are needed to evaluate the performance of the developed system. 
\subsection{Sampling Theory}

\paragraph{Nyquist-Criteria}
To fully reconstruct a bandlimited continuous signal 
\begin{equation}
y (t) \, \fourier  Y(f) \quad \text{with} \quad Y(f) = 0, \, |f| \geq \frac{B}{2}
\end{equation}
it has to be sampled with a frequency $f_A$ respecting:
\begin{equation}
f_A \geq B
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Sample-And-Hold-Amplifier}
ADCs need a certain amount of time to sample the input signal. If the value of the signal changes by more than one Least-Significant-Bit (LSB) during this period, this can result in large errors in the output signal. Therefore, so called Sample-And-Hold-Amplifiers (SHA) are used in front of ADCs to hold the  input value for the needed amount of time. The ADC sampling needs to be timed in such way, that the analog-to-digital conversion falls into the hold period of the SHA and doesn't exceed into the sample period.
