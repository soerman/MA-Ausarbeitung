The back-end readout card for the system under development, the Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC ZCU216 Evaluation Card, was chosen taking into consideration the points described in \autoref{sec:selection}. In this section, the overall architecture and features of the card are presented. A possibility for evaluation of the card is also demonstrated. At last, a design for the read-out firmware is proposed. 

\section{Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC ZCU216 Evaluation Card}
Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoCs: Combine RF data converter subsystem and forward error correction with industry-leading
programmable logic and heterogeneous processing capability. Integrated RF-ADCs, RF-DACs, and soft decision FECs (SD-FEC)
provide the key subsystems for multiband, multi-mode cellular radios and cable infrastructure


With the data converters integrated directly into the FPGA using parallel interfaces, they don't require the
prohibitively high-pin-count external connections needed for discrete parallel interface converters, allowing more converter

	\item Sixteen 14-bit, 2.5GSPS RF-ADC
	\item Sixteen 14-bit, 10GSPS RF-DAC
	\item I/O expansion options â€“ FPGA Mezzanine Card (FMC+) interfaces, RFMC 2.0 interfaces, and Pmod connections
