\chapter*{Abstract}

Terahertz science and laser applications need to analyse the characteristics of ultrafast events. Commercially available real-time equipment is limited in bandwidth (240 GS/s, LeCroy LabMaster 10-100Zi) and cannot be used to characterize these events in the pico-and femtosecond regime. In this thesis you will evaluate a real-time measurement technique based on the photonic time-stretch analog-to-digital converter (TS-ADC) for the measurement of ultrafast signals with a sampling-rate which exceeds TS/s. The principle is to use a photonic front-end that effectively “slows down” the analog signal in time before it is digitized by fast ADCs.
